# MetaOD

This is the codebase for ASE 2020 paper `Metamorphic Object Insertion for Testing Object Detection Systems`. 

We have also provided a Dropbox folder with all the MetaOD found erroneous detection results at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ivpprt96nycokd9/AAAZ_3D8TVAF25L90Z9AqpRya?dl=0.

More instructions on tool setup and installation will be given soon.
